# ðŸš— Car Length Classifier

This is a simple C++ console application that classifies the **type of a car** based on its **length in meters**. It uses basic conditional logic to determine whether a car is a hatchback, sedan, SUV, limousine, etc.

## ðŸ“š Theory

Vehicle classification is often based on several physical dimensions. One important parameter is the **length** of the car. Manufacturers and transportation standards classify cars into segments such as **hatchbacks, sedans, SUVs, and limousines** depending on their body length. This program simplifies that logic and demonstrates how cars can be categorized just by using their length.

## ðŸ§¾ Overview

This program:

- Takes user input for the **carâ€™s length (in meters)**.
- Uses **if-else statements** to determine the car category.
- Prints out the appropriate **car type** based on standard size ranges.
- Displays an error message if the input length does not fit into any known category.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

- **C++ Input/Output**: `cin` and `cout` for user interaction.
- **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `else if`, and `else` for decision-making.
- **Logical Operators**: `&&` to combine range checks.
- **Float Data Type**: for accepting decimal input (e.g., 4.3 meters).
- **Error Handling**: prints a messag
