# 🚗 Car Length Classifier

This is a simple C++ console application that classifies the **type of a car** based on its **length in meters**. It uses basic conditional logic to determine whether a car is a hatchback, sedan, SUV, limousine, etc.

---

## 📚 Theory

Vehicle classification is often based on several physical dimensions. One important parameter is the **length** of the car. Manufacturers and transportation standards classify cars into segments such as **hatchbacks, sedans, SUVs, and limousines** depending on their body length. This program simplifies that logic and demonstrates how cars can be categorized just by using their length.

## 🧾 Overview

This program:

- Takes user input for the **car’s length (in meters)**.
- Uses **if-else statements** to determine the car category.
- Prints out the appropriate **car type** based on standard size ranges.
- Displays an error message if the input length does not fit into any known category.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- **C++ Input/Output**: `cin` and `cout` for user interaction.
- **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `else if`, and `else` for decision-making.
- **Logical Operators**: `&&` to combine range checks.
- **Float Data Type**: for accepting decimal input (e.g., 4.3 meters).
- **Error Handling**: prints a messag







 # 🔢 Largest of Three Numbers - C++ Program

This is a simple C++ console application that takes **three integer inputs** from the user and determines the **largest number** among them using conditional statements.

## 📚 Theory

In basic mathematics and programming, comparing numbers is a foundational concept. This program implements a series of **nested `if-else` conditions** to compare three numbers (`a`, `b`, and `c`) and identify the largest among them.

## 🧾 Overview

The program:

- Prompts the user to enter three integers.
- Compares the values using nested `if-else` logic.
- Outputs which number is the largest.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- **C++ Input/Output** using `cin` and `cout`
- **Integer Data Type** for handling whole numbers
- **Conditional Statements** (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- **Nested Conditionals** to compare three values

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- To practice and demonstrate **basic comparison and decision-making** in C++.
- To reinforce understanding of **nested `if` statements**.
- To help beginners understand logical control flow through a real-world example.

## 🖥️ How to Run

### Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)

### Steps

```bash





# 🔤 Vowel or Consonant Checker (C++)

This is a simple C++ program that checks if the letter you enter is a **vowel** or a **consonant**.

##  What it does

- You enter a letter (like `a`, `b`, `z`, etc.)
- The program checks if it’s a vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`, upper or lowercase)
- It tells you if the letter is a **vowel** or a **consonant**
##  What I used

- `char` data type for taking a single character
- `cin` and `cout` for input/output
- `if` and `else` statements for checking the condition
- `||` (OR operator) to match any of the vowel letters

---
##  Example

Enter a letter: A
Letter is a vowel

Enter a letter: d
Letter is a consonant
